# GodTube

Hobby application which will use a YouTube API as the backend in order to replicate the YouTube app using clean architecture. Main goals are to use best practices in architecture, testing and exploring new stuff.

## TODO List
List of planned stuff which we will focus on while developing the app:
- MVVM
- Clean architecture
- Use combine for data binding and networking
- Use only first party libs
- Composition over inheritance
- Investigate possible solutions for navigation
- TDD
- Use code only for creating views
- Implement views to support rotations
- Support iPhone and iPads
- offline mode using CoreData
- Launch screen with animation
- Fastlane for certificate handling and in the future for automated builds
- Video preview on long press
- Look into POP
- Dark mode
- Dynamic fonts
- Siri integration
